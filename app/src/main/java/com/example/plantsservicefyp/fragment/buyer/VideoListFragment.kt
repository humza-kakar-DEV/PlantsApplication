Enzymes are activated, breaking down stored nutrients like starches and proteins, providing energy for growth. A root (radicle) and a shoot (embryonic stem) emerge. The root anchors the plant and absorbs water, while the shoot grows upward. Cotyledons or true leaves appear, starting photosynthesis. Photosynthesis, fueled by sunlight, begins, producing glucose for the plant's growth. With more leaves, stems, and roots, the plant can photosynthesize and absorb nutrients effectively. Continued growth leads to flower formation and, after pollination and fertilization, the development of seeds within the fruit. When mature, seeds are dispersed, fall to the ground, germinate, and grow into new plants, restarting the cycle."
